MONGODB_URI: mongodb://heroku_qh5rj8lb:ghjjga75hql1tlrcqo92eloe05@ds113626.mlab.com:13626/heroku_qh5rj8lb

// If deployed, use the deployed database. Otherwise use the local mongoHeadlines database    
`var MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI || "mongodb://localhost/mongoHeadlines";`




    Then, just pass the MONGODB_URI variable to mongoose.connect. If you define MONGODB_URI on heroku, your production app will automatically use the remote database

    You shouldn't connect to the remote database when developing locally. Your classroom's network may not function if you do (but it's also best practice to use a local databse for development).
